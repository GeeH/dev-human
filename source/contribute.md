# Contributing to dev-human

**dev-human** uses [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/), a static website generator created by [Beau Simensen](https://twitter.com/beausimensen) using [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/).
But you don't need to worry about any of this: the only thing you need in order to contribute with an article for **dev-human** is a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

The articles are written in **markdown**. You just need to create a new file in the project tree, following some simple rules, and make a pull request to submit your content.
You don't even need to clone the repository in your local machine - all can be done through the GitHub interface.

If you want to preview your article in the exact way it's going to be published on the website, than you'll need to
have PHP and Sculpin installed in your local machine.
