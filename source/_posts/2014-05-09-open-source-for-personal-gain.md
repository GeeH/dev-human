Open Source rocks! Everyone knows that. Community Works! Everyone knows that too. But aside from the obvious reasons to get involved in open source and the community, why should you _really_ bother?

##The Usual Stuff

It's well publicised that getting involved in the developer community, through open source (or otherwise) is a Good Thing. To quote Mr Community from the PHP world, "Community Works!" ([Michelangelo van Dam](http://www.dragonbe.com/)). 

It's also widely documented that getting involved gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside, helps you to give back to what you've taken, builds a network of peers, and all the other clichès that have been repeated more intelligently and by more knowledgable people than me. 

So what's the point of this post?

##Tangible Benefits

For me, being involved in The Community, and contributing to open source has actually given me much much more than a warm fuzzy feeling inside. I estimate that I'm earning *over £15,000* per year as a direct result of being involvled. And that's if you discount the thousands of pounds of travel and accomodation I've received in the previous year while speaking. I'm really going to try and stop this turning into a self-promotion puff piece, but I genuinely feel that I owe my career to the moment I discovered the greater developer community existed, and I'd like to try and explain to you why.
